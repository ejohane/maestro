# Beads configuration for worktree support
# See: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/WORKTREES.md

# Sync branch for worktree compatibility
# This allows the beads daemon to commit changes to a dedicated branch
# instead of the current branch, enabling full daemon support in worktrees.
# Without this, the daemon would be auto-disabled in worktrees.
